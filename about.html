                Hailed as “coolly unflappable and supremely competent”, with “an exquisite cello solo” by the LA Times, the Grammy winning artist Sunny Yang is a versatile cellist and dedicated educator who has collaborated with many of the world’s most accomplished composers and performers.

                As a member of the Kronos Quartet for ten years, she has continually reimagined the string quartet experience. She has performed concerts on the world’s most prestigious stages, commissioned over 500 new works, and released more than 12 critically acclaimed recordings including <em>Landfall</em>, the Grammy Award-winning collaboration with Laurie Anderson; the Grammy Award-winning <em>Sun Rings</em>, featuring Terry Riley’s monumental NASA commissioned work; and The Music of Moondog which won The German Critics’ Award; among many others.

                An advocate for music education, Sunny has led workshops and masterclasses with renowned institutions such as Carnegie Hall’s Weill Music Institute, Stanford University, Royal College of Music (Sweden), and Holland Festival.

These works, made freely available in the public domain, include published scores and parts, recordings, and pedagogical materials designed for
                players of all levels and ages, providing invaluable resources for the next generation of musicians.
